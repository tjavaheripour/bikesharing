# bikesharing

## Overview:
In this project, we used Tableau in our presentation as a tool to create our story and visualize bike-sharing data.
We want to convince a potential investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike-share program in Des Moines. The first step is to figure out how the bike-share business actually works in New York City.
For this project, we used trip data from the Citi Bike program in New York City from August 2019 because there is likely more traffic during the summer months.
