## Overview:
In this project, we used Tableau in our presentation to create our story and visualize bike-sharing data. We want to convince a potential investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike-share program in Des Moines. The first step is to discover how the bike-share business actually works in New York City. In order to do so, we used trip data from the Citi Bike program in New York from August 2019 because there is likely more traffic during the summer months.

Furthermore, most trips are less than an hour, indicating that Citi Bike service could be used as an alternative to public transportation by commuters.  

Some additional visualizations :
- The number of trips by age groups during weekday.
- visualize data for different months and seasons of the year to find the correlation between the weather and renting bikes
